                ques1="Q1 : What Is Cyber Security?"
                ans1="A: Cyber security consists of technologies, processes, and controls designed to protect businesses and their systems, networks, devices, and data from cyber-attacks. Cyber security aims to protect all computer systems from being seriously damaged or leaving the victim with no/limited access to their confidential files."
                ques2="Q2: What is the eligibility criterion for cyber security?"
                ans2="A: The eligibility criterion for cyber security is that candidates need to have basic knowledge of computer science and networking. Careerera has designed the course from basic to advanced ensuring better understanding for the candidates. "
                ques3="Q3: Is Cyber security a promising career?"
                ans3="


                A: Yes Cyber security is one of the promising careers and it becomes promising due to following reasons:

                Low unemployment: One of the most significant benefits of getting into Cyber security right now is high demand.
                
                Salary: Due to such high demand and a relatively low supply of qualified professionals, Cyber security has pretty good salary ranges.
                
                Remote Work: Even before covid-19, because most of the work will be focused on technology and working with people in different parts of the world, you can often work from home.
                
                Education and Certification: Fortunately, you do not need a degree in Cyber security to get into the field.
                "
                ques4="Q4 : How challenging is Cyber security?"
                ans4="

                A: We at Careerera enable learning from the scratch where our trainers teach everything from the basics which makes the learning really smooth, it hardly matters that candidate has a technical background. "
