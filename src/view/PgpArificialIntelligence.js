                    <div className="des_content">
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence is perhaps the most popular word in general usage which has its origins
                            in the Computer Science field. This is because of all the science fiction movies containing
                            robots which can speak and spaceships which have automated guidance and defense
                            systems. Due to this misappropriation by the media the word has been widely misunderstood.
                            But anyone who takes an <strong>Artificial Intelligence course online</strong> will learn what the real
                            meaning of Artificial Intelligence is.</p>
                        <p>This <strong>Artificial Intelligence certification</strong> will teach the learners that Artificial Intelligence is a
                            field of computer science in which the programmer attempts to impart human-like intelligence
                            to machines. They use techniques and algorithms which give machines the ability to engage
                            in reasoning processes and processes of logic quite similar to what a rational human being
                            would follow. <strong>Artificial Intelligence training</strong> will let programmers give machines the ability to
                            understand complex relationships, interpret them meaningfully, and take actionable decisions
                            on the basis of those calculations. Such machines, if left alone in a navigable environment,
                            will be able to interpret the elements present in the environment and be able to take certain
                            paths of actions based on their observations. So Artificial Intelligence lets programmers
                            impart such powers of perception to machines. Not only will they be able to interpret the
                            environment, but they will also be able to detect their mistakes, record them, and process
                            them to learn how to perform better the next time they are in the same environment.</p>

                data2={<><p>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which aims to teach machines to learn
                    from their environment on their own without any outside aid or interference. The method they
                    use is that they supply the machines with massive data sets as inputs. Then they program
                    specific machine learning algorithms into the machines which give them the ability to analyze
                    the massive data sets and accept them as their own past experiences. Thus a new machine
                    can be given the memory of a used machine. They then extract patterns from these data sets
                    and use these patterns to form new knowledge. This course is one of the <strong>Machine learning
                        courses online</strong> which will teach a learner how to do so.</p>
                    <p>Initially the programmers have to program specific algorithms into the machines to teach them
                        how to learn, to put it simply. But after the machines are supplied with massive data sets as
                        inputs, they are able to draw upon these banks of past experience and draw new conclusions.
                        So one can take this <strong>PG diploma in Machine learning and AI</strong> to gain the knowledge and
                        skills required to perform this feat. Our <strong>AI and Machine learning course</strong> includes topics such
                        as Data preprocessing, Data wrangling, Typecasting, Labor hours comparison, Time series
                        modeling, Removal of non-stationarity, Text mining, Lemmatization, Rendering syntax trees,
                        structuring sentences with chunking and chunk parsing, Context-free grammar etc.</p>

                data10="In schools a large amount of time is spent in taking the rollcall and attendance of students. Teachers can use the same time in revising important concepts from the subject study matter with the students or in checking their assignments more painstakingly. The learner’s task is to create an Automatic attendance system that automates the process of taking attendance. It should use AI and ML algorithms related to computer vision to recognize and identify the faces of the incoming students and check their names against a school database." />

                ques6="Q6 : What is the definition of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? What makes it so important?"
                ans6="


                A : Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are a very important part of Computer Science. They are quite interrelated with each other and have many points in common. Artificial Intelligence is at its most basic level a technology which enables machines to exhibit simulations of human behaviour. The main goal of AI is to develop intelligent computer systems which can solve complex problems of the world in a human-like manner. Machine Learning and Deep learning are two major components of AI. AI is a vast field and has a very diverse range of applications and scope. AI systems are more concerned with using the science of probability and prediction to maximize the chances of success of a system in solving a problem. Artificial intelligence has 3 main stages of operation – learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Often humans have to deal with not only structured data but semi- structured and unstructured data as well. Therefore any AI system should be fully equipped to handle not only structured data but semi-structured and unstructured data as well.

                Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is heavily dependent on past data. It is a science which allows machines to learn about new patterns and new courses of action on the basis of past data related to the same problem domain. Computer systems are taught how to proceed along certain lines of action and how to take certain decisions when faced with a certain matrix of choices and problems. This is why this field is called Machine “learning.” Machine learning is much narrower in scope than the broad scope of Artificial Intelligence. Computer systems trained by machine learning can only perform actions and tasks for which they have been explicitly taught the appropriate lines of response. They can not predict problems and solution sets in advance like the “intelligent” machines from the wider scope of Artificial Intelligence can.

                ques7="Q7 : Is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning expert a good Career choice?"
                ans7="A : Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is in huge demand in many industries, ranging from IT to Finance to Ecommerce to Manufacturing to Healthcare to Retail. It is the fastest growing job on Linkedin and is predicted to create 20 million jobs by 2026. This makes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning a very lucrative career choice. Also, the number of people who actually possess the requisite skillsets to become a complete Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning expert is very little. Thus, there is a high demand of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning experts but a low supply of qualified people. So Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning experts can demand as big a salary as they want and the companies will have to comply with their demands."
                ques8="Q8 : What are the skills required to start a job in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning?"
                ans8="A : The skills you will require to land a job in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are – Testing and iterating skills, Python functions, packages, and routines knowledge, Mathematical knowledge, Physics knowledge, Mechanics knowledge, cognitive learning theory knowledge, language processing knowledge, Critical thinking skills, Curiosity, Out-of-the-box thinking skills, Technical skills, Signal processing techniques knowledge."
                ques9="Q9 : Who is eligible for taking the PGP in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course from Careerera?"
                ans9="


            A : Companies who will seek to hire Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learningers will look for the following degrees -

            12 th pass from the Science stream or IT stream.
